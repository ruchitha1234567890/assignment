Posters need to be life-like. As close as possible to the scenes you see in dreamwork or disney movies.

The Story

First Bell at Misty Hill School
Pema, a red panda with soft russet fur and thoughtful eyes, liked to walk to school before the village was fully awake. The hills were quiet then, and the clouds hung low like sleepy scarves across the trees. She took the winding path slowly, her paws making soft prints in the morning dew.
At the bend near the prayer flag tree, someone was waiting. Temba, a woolly Himalayan black bear, waved with both paws. “I thought I’d be the first today,” he grinned, a little out of breath. His ears twitched in the breeze.
“You’re early,” Pema said with a smile. “Did you take the steep trail again?”
“I ran most of the way,” Temba said proudly, then sat down on a flat stone. “Only tripped twice.”
They sat quietly for a moment, listening. Far off, a woodpecker tapped on a pine. Somewhere below, a goat bleated. Mist still curled along the ridgeline, soft and slow.
Then came a rustle from the hillside above.
Kima slid down a patch of dry grass, landing in a happy tumble near their feet. He was a grey langur, lanky and full of energy. “Guess who found a secret shortcut!” he announced, brushing twigs from his fur.
“You say that every week,” said Pema.
“This time it’s actually secret,” Kima insisted, holding up a shiny acorn as proof. “Also, there’s a rock shaped like a mango. I licked it just to check.”
Temba giggled. “Was it sweet?”
“Mostly just dusty,” Kima said, making a face.
Just then, a flutter of wings passed overhead. Pihu swooped down in a lazy spiral and landed beside them. She was a Himalayan bulbul with bright eyes and a musical voice. “The wind’s perfect today,” she said, fluffing her feathers. “You could float all the way to the lake if you wanted.”
Kima’s eyes lit up. “Let’s try it!”
“Not now,” Pema said gently. “We’ll be late.”
The four of them turned toward the last bend in the trail, where the school roof peeked out from behind the pines.
And there, as always, came Kunu.
He didn’t speak right away. Kunu was a young goral—a nimble mountain goat with soft grey fur and steady steps. He simply nodded at the others, then pointed toward the mountain ridge.
A line of sunlight had just touched the snowcap above. The clouds were lifting.
“Clear day,” Kunu said softly. “You can see the whole peak.”
They stood for a moment, all five, watching the morning open up before them. The forest shimmered with birdsong. The air smelled of pine and slate.
Then—ding ding ding!—the school bell rang, faint but bright.
“Last one to the gate is a sleepy snail!” Kima shouted, already halfway there.
Pema walked behind the others, smiling to herself. New notebooks, clean chalkboards, stories waiting to begin. She liked the first day of school. It always felt a little bit like the first page of a book.
